## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for form validation and interactions

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on improving my skills in:

- Form validation using JavaScript:

This helped me ensure all required fields are filled before submission and display custom error messages.

- Radio buttons and checkboxes styling:

I learned that you cannot style native radio/checkbox inputs easily, so styling the parent container is a more reliable approach.

- Responsive design using media queries:

This allowed me to make the form mobile-friendly without breaking the layout.

- Accessibility:

Using aria-live regions for error messages.
Ensuring the form can be navigated with keyboard only.
